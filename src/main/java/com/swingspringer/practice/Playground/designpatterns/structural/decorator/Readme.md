I did this task, although to be honest I still didn't get much how to use it fully.

All I know is decorators wraps an existing interface/class and intercept the process,
perhaps adding or modifying one of its behaviours.

Note:  Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors 
to objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects.
